# matrix-03-duggal-malinsky-ke

## **Distributed parallel computing**
1. Explain the architecture of your solution.

2. Explain the variations of algorithm you implemented.

## **Teamwork**
1. Ziyi ke - Generated the graphs, wrote the OpenMP algorithm, wrote the automation in python.

2. Domenic K Malinsky - Wrote the SIMD algorithm and main file, altered the Matrix multiplication with OpenMP and MPI with assistance from rishi. 

3. Rishi Duggal - Implemented the algorithms into the existing code and ran through the compiling process.

Did you lock the master branch as explain in GitHW2 Lab 2 - Git? How did you proceed to review each other work?
  > We did lock the master branch before starting any code, when it came to reviewing each other's work it was fairly straightforward all of us met up when we     worked on the assignment so when we were writing the code everything was bounced off each other so we didn't have to review when merging with the main         branch since it was all one joint effort.

## **Full project life cycle**
1. Have you used a project board? How did you used it, or if you did not use a project board how did you plan and manage your project and team work?
> We created a project board at the start of the assignment just so we can have one location to view everything we needed to get done. Everytime we finished a task we made sure to mark it done so we knew what we needed to finish. We worked on each task as a team for the most part with some exceptions to the other task that only one of us worked on while the other two coded.
2. Is the usual cycle: write code, compile code,  run code, test code was the same when doing remote development on Wolfgand cluster. Did you need to adapt your way of working or use different tools?
> While the general cycle of writing, compiling, running, and testing code remains the same for remote development on Wolfgand cluster, there may be some adjustments needed in terms of tools and processes. For example, when working on a remote cluster, there may be additional steps involved in connecting to the cluster, and transferring files to and from the cluster.Additionally, depending on the specific tools and technologies used on the cluster, there may be additional steps involved in building and running the code. For example, if using MPI or OMP, the code may need to be compiled with specific compiler flags or run with specific command-line options to take advantage of parallel processing capabilities.

3. What kind of testing did you plan to use for this project? Did you consider measuring speed, memory consumption and validity of results for matrix multiplication. Did you consider that the code provided by the professor could have flaws?

4. Did you need to write code or use tools to generate random matrix of specific sizes? Did you put this in your plan? 

5. Did you put in your plan the work needed to generate tables or graphs? Did you automate this work?  
> We did automate the process of generating the graphs and tables needed to show our data.

6. What proportion of the tasks (and time) in your plan is  about writing variations on the matrix multiplication algorithm and what proportion is about testing and reporting activities?
